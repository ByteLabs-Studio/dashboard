# Todo List

## I'll use this for now since I have alot I wanna do, and making a TODO file will make this pretty easy to remember.

### - Sign-In System

### - User Uploaded Functions

I didn't make any reason for why I needed the sign-in system, because this is the actual reason, I wanna make a system where users can upload their own bytebeat functions and them show up in the functions tab, and replace the default functions that are hardcoded, the issue with this is i need to make a server sided system which connects to a database (probably PostgreSQL since I'm familiar with it), but I need to also figure out how to make it so only users can upload their functions, along with an approve or deny system, mainly to make sure only bytebeats which are actually bytebeats and work, can be sent through

### - Flairs / Tagging

The functions tab has a navigation bar on the left which is used for filtering the results by a function type, if i take this into consideration and make a system where whenever a user adds a new functioon, they have to tag it by a specific type, which I will probably hardcode types in order to make it easier and not so random, right now the tab only shows results for whatever is existing, meaning if i make a new bytebeat without changing any of the code for the bar, it will add a new entry without needing changes, so that being dynamic would technically work the same way as it does right now, i just need to find a way to allow users to tag functions.
